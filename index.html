            The first time I saw you, I had already fallen in love, but I was too shy to say it. 
            I felt a little awkward because of our friends. However, the moment when the two of us went 
            to a concert—although we didn't really spend much time together and I made you wait for a 
            minute because of my friend—was really memorable.<span class="c3space hspace Aspace Ipspace" id="space"> That was the day that sparked my feelings
             for you. It was also the day of our first real
             conversation in a long time, and that gave me the 
              confidence to compliment you and tell you how I truly felt. &#8681; </span>

        <div id="second-p" class="c3second hsecond Asecond Ipsecond">
          <p id="second-textp" class="c3Sparag hSparag ASparag IpSparag">
            After I confessed my feelings to you and told you, "liligawan kita," I knew in my heart that I was willing to risk everything for you, I want us to be happy and together. 
            Even though I'm shy and sometimes I struggle to keep a long conversation going over chat, I still tried because, well, "ikaw na yan, e." 
            Talking to you feels like playing an adventure game—it’s fun, exciting, and full of surprises. And honestly, I’d spend as much time as it takes to figure out every little detail, 
            just to know you better. Over time, I found myself genuinely enjoying our conversations, but I also started to feel drained. It wasn’t because of you, it was because I felt like I was always the one reaching out. 
            If I didn’t start the conversation, it felt like we wouldn’t talk at all. &#8681;

            I’m not upset with you—I’m more frustrated with myself. I wish I could entertain you as effortlessly as others do, or as I do with my own friends. I'm also disappointed that I can’t give you small things like flowers, or even just more of my time. I'm more focused on my academics that time, trying to keep up with you, has made it hard for me to manage my time. I want to support you the way your friends do, but I struggle to ask for help. In the end, I just wish I could be there for you in the way I always imagined.
